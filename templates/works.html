<h3>How do Capacitors Work?</h3>
<p>Capacitors are simple devices that store electrical energy in an imbalance of electrical charge. Two electrodes are placed very close to one another (as close as possible without touching), and a voltage is applied across them. As electrons gather on one electrode, they induce an opposite charge in the other. If these two plates are suddenly cut off from the circuit, the charge imbalance remains, and energy is stored, as in a battery. Because charge only accumulates on the surface of conductors, the surface area affects the capacitance, or amount of charge that a capacitor will hold when a given voltage is applied across it. Also, the closer the electrodes are, the higher the capacitance, because the electric field between the electrodes becomes stronger as the opposite charges are brought closer together. A third factor that affects capacitance is the ability of the area in between the electrodes to convey the electric field between them. While this area may be just a vacuum, materials (not necessarily conductors) whose molecules align in the direction of an electric field make better dielectrics than a vacuum.

	Now the above equation is relevant, where C is the capacitance, A is the surface area of one electrode, d is the distance between the electrodes, epsilon is the permittivity of the dielectric, or its ability to convey an electric field, and k is a constant for SI units.

<h4>Ultracapacitors and Activated Carbon</h4>
<p>In an effort to increase surface area, many capacitors are made of long “parallel plates,” separated by a thin dielectric and rolled up to form a space-efficient spiral.
But when even the electrodes themselves have high surface area on a microscopic scale, they become the basis for supercapacitors: ultra-high-capacitance capacitors.

<br>
The high-surface-area material of choice for many years has been activated carbon or charcoal, a highly porous form of carbon. Because electrons simply occupy space in electrodes and no chemical reactions take place, these carbon supercapacitors can be cycled hundreds of thousands of times before they begin to suffer from significant decreases in power output or capacitance. But after enough use, the capacitance of a supercapacitor will decrease. According to the above equation, and noting that the distance between the electrodes does not change significantly, either the dielectric, or the surface area of the electrodes, or both, must degrade.

	Electron microscopy allows for the observation of the microstructure of a capacitor before and after tens of thousands of cycles.
