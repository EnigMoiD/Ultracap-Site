    <h4>Graphene Ultracapacitors</h4>
    <dl>
      <dt>What They Are</dt>
      <dd>Graphene ultracapacitors are a type of ultracapacitor that use graphene in high surface area electrodes. Like all ultracapacitors, they have high power densities. Grapheneâ€™s high conductivity and incredibly large surface area per volume give it many advantages over traditional ultracapacitors</dd>
      <dt>Pros</dt>
      <dd>
	Relatively energy dense, very power dense, long lifespan, made from sustainable ingredients (carbon).
      </dd>
      <dt>Cons</dt>
      <dd>
	Only exist in research labs, expensive to produce.
      </dd>
      <dt>Takeaway</dt>
      <dd>
	Their combination of high power density, reasonable energy density, and long life make them well suited for a wide variety of applications. These range from consumer electronics, due to their high energy content and quick charging rate, to regenerative braking, due to their efficiency and ability provide large amounts of power.
      </dd>
      <dt> Sustainability </dt>
      <dd>
	Graphene is quite a difficult material to produce. Some methods, such as chemical vapor deposition, are relatively clean processes with minimal hazards produced. Others, such as Hummers' method, require many toxic acids and produce a lot of waste.
	Once the device itself is made, the materials in it are quite sustainable. The device can be used for extremely long time with very high cycle counts. When the capacitor is no longer useful, both the graphene and the electrolyte can be biodegradable.

    <h4>Fuel cells</h4>
    <dl>
      <dt>What They Are</dt>
      <dd>
	Most fuel cells work by oxidizing a fuel like hydrogen, taking advantage of the electrical current generated in the process. Thus the byproduct of the chemical reaction is often simply water.
      </dd>
      <dt>Pros</dt>
      <dd>
	More energy dense than batteries, fuel is renewable not dependent on natural resources, nonpolluting, low maintenance, silent and safe, high electrical efficiency of 60-70% (3x internal combustion engines).
      </dd>
      <dt>Cons</dt>
      <dd>
	Too expensive and low power / low lifetime to compete with gas/combustion engines today, low durability, low power density (10-100x less than combustion engines), does not allow bidirectional energy flow, slow start-up/power response/acceleration, and hydrogen is dangerous to store.
      </dd>
      <dt>Takeaway</dt>
      <dd>
	Fueld cells are being developed to replace batteries, are ideal when an electrical supply is required, and will be more commercially important when they can be manufactured more cheaply. It is better used as a steady source of energy and not a dynamic one: good in conjunction with a battery or ultracapacitor to provide steady energy.
      </dd>
      <dt> Sustainability </dt>
      <dd>Fuel cells can run on a number of different fuel sources. One common fueld is hydrogen: hydrogen and oxygen gas react to form water. Both of these chemicals occur naturally, but hydrogen is difficult to find and keep pure. So the viability of these fuel cells relies heavily on the availability of hydrogen. In an ideal world, a nation would have a hydrogen economy in place where the distribution of hydrogen is stable.</dd>

    <h4>Activated Carbon Ultracapacitors</h4>
    <dl>
      <dt>What They Are</dt>
      <dd>
	Ultracapacitors, like capacitors, generate energy through the buildup of opposing charges on the two capacitor plates. Ultracapacitors can have extremely high capacitances by increasing the surface area of the plates, which is done by coating the plates with activated carbon, a spongy and porous material. They are also called electrical double layer capacitors because each carbon electrode has two layers of charge coating its surface.
      </dd>
      <dt>Pros</dt>
      <dd>
	High power density, low internal resistance, much higher capacitance than a normal capacitor, more efficient than batteries, long life, more environmentally friendly than batteries.
    </dd>
    <dt>Cons</dt>
    <dd>
      Relatively low energy density, low voltage means that ultracaps have to be used in series to have the voltage of a battery, unsteady voltage because it drops as an ultracap discharges, fire hazard if the circuit shorts due to low internal resistance, trying to increase voltage/energy is expensive and leads to reduced power.
    </dd>
    <dt>Takeaway</dt>
    <dd>
      Their power density makes them great at meeting surge power demands on hybrid vehicles. With further development, they may be able to store as much energy as batteries in the same size/weight package.
    </dd>
    <dt> Sustainability </dt>
    <dd> These devices are mostly made of carbon, and are thus biodegradable. Theses devices also can be charged and discharged many times, so they will not have to be replaced and reprocessed very often.</dd>

<div class="" link="Gas">
  <h4>Gasoline</h4>
  <dl>
    <dt>What They Are</dt>
    <dd>In 1879, the first gasoline powered automobile was created. This development spawned a paradigm shift in transportaiton. Since then, gasoline has been used almost everywhere power is needed. Gasoline engines generate power by combusting the fuel in small, controlled bursts to a shaft or turbine.</dd>
    <dt>Pros</dt>
    <dd>Very energy dense and powerful for its weight. Historically, gasoline has been fairly cheap.</dd>
    <dt>Cons</dt>
    <dd>Getting more and more expensive. Not sustainable. Creates greenhouse and toxic gasses.</dd>
    <dt>Takeaway</dt>
    <dd>Gasoline is not the future of energy storage both because of the lack of remaining resources and its environmental impact. This technology will remain in use while new technologies and products are developed. Because of its exceptionally high energy and power density, it may see continued use in smaller-scale applications where such power density is required, as more efficient and clean combustion methods are developed.</dd>
    <dt> Sustainability </dt>
    <dd> Gasoline is terrible for the environment. Its consumption creates many greenhouse gases and other toxic fumes. In addition to this face, the amount of oil on the earth is decreasing and prices are increasing.</dd>

<div class="" link="Lion">
  <h4>Lithium ion</h4>
  <dl>
    <dt>What They Are</dt>
    <dd>Lithium ion batteries, much like all other battery technologies, convert chemical energy into electrical energy. These devices have 2 electrodes (anode and cathode) and an electrolyte. The anode of the battery is made of Lithium cobalt oxide, and the cathode is made of carbon. Li+ ions travel through the ion porous membrane and collect on the cathode when powering, and the reverse process takes place during charging.</dd>
    <dt>Pros</dt>
    <dd>
      Instant power. No hassle. Easy to use and variable in size, temperature, chemical system, orientation. Can provide pulses of high current. High energy density and lighter than many other batteries, like the nickel metal hydride cell. Often rechargeable.
    </dd>
    <dt>Cons</dt>
    <dd>
      Power discharge must be regulated to ensure long term battery health. Charging takes multiple hours. Short lifetime and low cycle count. Low energy density and expensive in comparison to traditional fuels. Risk of explosions and fires. Lithium is difficult to mine and the mining process harms the environment.
    </dd>
    <dt>Takeaway</dt>
    <dd>
      Currently used in almost all modern electronic devices that require mobile power. Goto for high quality batteries.
    </dd>
    <dt> Sustainability </dt>
	<dd>The biggest fault to Lithium ion batteries is that they are small and used everywhere, and the batteries go bad after only a few years. As devices are no longer used, these batteries end up in landfills, polluting the environment. Lithium's mining process also negatively affects its sustainability.</dd>

  <h4>Lead Acid</h4>
  <dl>
    <dt>What They Are</dt>
    <dd></dd>
    <dt>Pros</dt>
    <dd>
      Instant power. No hassle. Easy to use and variable in size, temperature, chemical system, orientation. Easy to make. Reliable. Can store energy for a long period of time. Can supply very high surge currents. Cheap and has established recycling processes resulting in 98% of US lead acid batteries being recycled.
    </dd>
    <dt>Cons</dt>
    <dd>
      Power discharge must be regulated to ensure health. Charging takes multiple hours. Low lifetime. Low energy content and expensive in comparison to traditional fuels.  Lead is a toxic metal. Acids are dangerous. Do not operate well in low temperatures.
    </dd>
    <dt>Takeaway</dt>
    <dd>
      Lead Acid batteries are mainly used in automobiles because of their ability to supply high current for the spark plugs while holding their charge for long periods of time to power minor systems. Their low energy density, high weight, and dangerous chemicals keep them out of most consumer devices.
    </dd>
    <dt> Sustainability </dt>
    <dd>Lead acid batteries contain lead. Although they are packaged quite well, large quantities of lead can escaped throughout their use. It has been estimated that around 2,600,000 metric tons of lead have been released into the environment from car batteries alone. This level of lead is not healthy for humans or the environment and cannot continue at the current rate.</dd>
