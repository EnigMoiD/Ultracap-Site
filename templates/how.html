<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Graphene is a material that is becoming increasingly relevant in modern applications. (Add shit about why graphene is awesome and what it can be used for). As a result, there is a lot of new emerging research on better methods to produce graphene. The main method in use is the Hummer’s method, which has been around since the 1950’s, and uses highly concentrated acids to produce graphene oxide from graphite. Although the Hummer’s method is relatively consistent and requires little high tech equipment, it is not particularly environmentally friendly, which has opened the door to a lot of other methods. These methods include chemical vapor deposition, mechanical exfoliation, and even extraction of graphene oxide from sugar and carbon dioxide, and analysis of these methods has shown that they all have strengths and weaknesses.</p>

<h3>Chemical Vapor Deposition</h3>
<p>Chemical vapor deposition has definite benefits as a method for certain applications. The method is carried out by heating a metal substrate such as copper to a high temperature like 1000C under low vacuum. Then methane and hydrogen gases are sent through the furnace and the methane reacts with the metal substrate, with hydrogen as a catalyst, in order to deposit a single layer of carbon on the substrate. The graphene crystallization starts at different “nucleation sites” on the substrate, from which crystals grow as carbons are deposited, until the borders meet. CVD is not the most common method because it requires some expensive technology, and still has a fair amount of impurities due to the chemicals needed. In addition, the process is not totally understood, so the details of the process (chemicals, temp, etc, amount of annealing done on the substrate) are still somewhat experimental. That said, for use in things like solar cells where large sheets are needed, CVD is the go-to method, because other methods like mechanical exfoliation can only produce micron large pieces of graphene..

<h3>Mechanical exfoliation</h3>
<p>Mechanical exfoliation, also known as the "scotch tape method" for producing graphene, takes advantage of the fact that pure graphite flakes are just made of many graphene sheets stick together. Scotch tape can pull these sheets apart from each other, and after enough separations there will be some sections of single-layer graphite present on the tape. The tape is applied to and subsequently removed from a flat silicon wafer, which is then examined under a light microscope. Graphene sheets appear as small, arbitrarily shaped sections slightly darker than the surrounding silicon wafer, because a single sheet of graphene absorbs about 2.3% of white light (http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008PhRvL.100k7401K). Once graphene has been produced, the tape can be dissolved chemically, and the graphene used for further study. This method is cheap, not very difficult, and relatively reliable for producing small amounts of graphene, but it does not scale well.</p>

<h3>Hummers method:</h3>
<p>Another common way to get graphene is from graphene oxide. Graphene oxide is a single layer carbon oxygen based substance containing 2.1 part carbon to 2.9 part oxygen.(http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja01539a017) Graphene oxide can be reduced to form graphene using a number of different methods including high heat, such as from a laser or LightScribe DVD burner, optically with a strong Xenon flash ,(http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja902348k), and chemically with hydrazine. (http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2011.02.071).</p>
<p>The most common method today used to produce graphene oxide is hummers method. Hummers method, created in 1957 by Hummer remains the industry standard for its ease of use and safety. Hummers goal was to create a method that was safer and faster than previously existing methods. It relies on separating the layers of flake graphite using highly concentrated sulfuric and sodium nitrate. (http://www.scribd.com/doc/59081747/Hummer-s-Method) While this method works to produce graphene oxide, there have been a number of improvements in the last 50 years to make the process safer and more reilable. These new methods revolve around sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid along with potassium permanganate to form a highly oxidizing solution.(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20731455)</p>
<p>Despite all of these improvements this method remains highly dangerous and not environmentally friendly. These reactions are highly acidic and very exothermic. Great care must be taken both in mixing and disposing of these chemicals.</p>
<p>This method is considered the industry standard due to its ease of production. One does not need to have expensive equipment or highly specialized chemicals to create graphene.</p>

<h3>Graphene Oxide Production from Carbon Dioxide</h3>
<p>A relatively new method has been introduced with the end result of converting carbon dioxide to graphene oxide using ammonia borane (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3277841/pdf/nihms-350959.pdf). The method can be simplified to two main steps. Carbon dioxide is first reduced by ammonia borane at temperatures less than 100C and pressures less than 3MPa to produce a solid product. This solid product is then demposed in an inert atmosphere at temperatures above 600C to produce graphene oxide. This process is very well documented and seems to be environmentally friendly, but is likely similar to CVD in that it requires precise and expensive equipment, because there are many steps of the process which require precise pressure control.</p>

<h3>Sketchy Methods</h3>
<p>Because of the high cost of the chemical vapor deposition method and the danger and environmental impact involved in hummer’s method for producing graphene oxide, a number of other methods have been developed recently that claim to be cheaper, more accessible, and more sustainable. Unfortunately, the creators of most of these methods have left key details about their processes out of their published works, and as a result none of these methods have gained enough traction to supplant Hummer’s or CVD as a dominant method of graphene production.</p>
<p>One interesting method, first described in a 2012 article in the Journal of Materials Chemistry, involves heating pressurized sugar water in an autoclave. The authors of the paper claim that this grows graphene oxide via hydrothermal synthesis, a process where the components of a crystal are driven out of a water solution when the solution is heated and pressurized. They have left the pressures they used out of their paper, and don’t go into great detail in describing their autoclaving process, which seems to be the most important process in their production of graphene oxide nanosheets.</p>
