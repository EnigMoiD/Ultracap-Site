  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>
    Graphene is a material that is becoming increasingly relevant in modern applications. Graphene is a near perfect thermal conductor as well as an amazing electrical conductor. It is stronger than diamond along its plane, yet still deformable like tissue paper. Graphene is also incredibly light as it is only one atom thick [<a href="http://www.graphene.manchester.ac.uk/story/properties/">source</a>]. All these make graphene a very desirable material, and much research has been put into its production as a result. The main method in use is Hummers' method, which has been around since the 1950’s, and uses highly concentrated acids and strong oxidizers to produce graphene oxide from graphite. Although Hummers' method is relatively consistent and requires little high tech equipment, it is not particularly environmentally friendly, which has opened the door to a lot of other methods. These methods include chemical vapor deposition, mechanical exfoliation, and even production of graphene oxide from sugar and carbon dioxide. There is no ideal method, and analysis of these methods has shown that they all have their strengths and weaknesses.

<div class="" link="CVD">
  <h3> CVD </h3>
  <dl>
    <dt>What it is</dt>
    <dd>Chemical vapor deposition is done by heating a metal substrate to about 1000C under low vacuum. Methane and hydrogen gases are then sent through the furnace, and the methane reacts with the metal substrate to form a single layer of carbon on it.</dd>
    <dt>Pros</dt>
    <dd>By far the best method of graphene production when large sheets are needed, pretty easy to do if the machinery is available</dd>
    <dt>Cons</dt>
    <dd>Requires expensive machinery, graphene has a fair amount of impurities due to the chemicals, and some specifics of the process are still experimental</dd>
    <dt>Takeaways</dt>
    <dd>Chemical vapor deposition is great to use when the machinery is available, especially if large flakes are needed (for things like solar cells). It also does not produce nearly as much waste as other methods.</dd>

<div class="" link="Exfoliation">
  <h3>Mechanical Exfoliation</h3>
  <dl>
    <dt>What it is</dt>
    <dd>Also known as the “scotch tape method”, mechanical exfoliation attempts to use scotch tape to pull graphene sheets from graphite through repeated separations of the graphite using scotch tape.</dd>
    <dt>Pros</dt>
    <dd>By far the easiest method of graphene production. Only requires graphite (which could just be a pencil point) and scotch tape</dd>
    <dt>Cons</dt>
    <dd>The method can only produce very small sheets of graphene. Once graphene is produced, one still has to remove the tape.</dd>
    <dt>Takeaway</dt>
    <dd>This is the best method to use to get graphene quickly if there is no advanced equipment available. That said, it is difficult to use the produced graphene for any useful applications. This method also has little waist and is quite environmentally friendly.</dd>

<div class="" link="Hummers">
  <h3>Hummers method</h3>
  <dl>
    <dt>What it is</dt>
    <dd>Created in 1957, Hummers' method is the most common method used to produce graphene oxide. It works by separating graphite into thinner flakes using highly concentrated sulfuric acid and sodium nitrate (<a href=http://www.scribd.com/doc/59081747/Hummer-s-Method>source</a>), or in some alternatives, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, and potassium permanganate (<a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20731455>source</a>). This graphene oxide can then be reduced to graphene by a variety of methods, including using a LightScribe DVD burner or a strong Xenon flash (<a h ref=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja902348k>source</a>)</dd>
    <dt>Pros</dt>
    <dd>Hummers' method is very reliable and does not require extremely specialized equipment, which explains why it has stuck around for over 50 years.</dd>
    <dt>Cons</dt>
    <dd>Hummers' method takes longer than many other methods of graphene productions, is pretty time consuming, and uses highly concentrated acids and oxidizing solutions that are not particularly safe.l</dd>
    <dt>Takeaway</dt>
    <dd>Hummers' method will continue to be widely used due to its reliability, but researchers will continue to develop alternatives to try to make the process more safe and environmentally friendly. In addition, as more sustainable methods become reliable, Hummers' method may lose some of its following. To create 5g of graphene oxide, around over 500ml of waste is created.</dd>

<div class="" link="CO2">
  <h3>Graphene Oxide Production from Carbon Dioxide</h3>
  <dl>
    <dt>What it is</dt>
    <dd>This is a relatively new method that converts carbon dioxide to graphene oxide by first reducing the carbon dioxide with ammonia borane and then decomposing the solid to graphene oxide using an inert atmosphere at temperatures above 600C.</dd>
    <dt>Pros</dt>
    <dd>Despite being fairly new, the process seems precise, sustainable, and reliable. In addition, most of the the temperature and pressure intensive processes are done with one machine, the differential scanning calorimeter (DSC)</dd>
    <dt>Cons</dt>
    <dd>The process requires some very precise pressure and temperature control, which may be difficult depending on the available equipment. In addition, the process has a fair amount of steps, resulting in a lot of opportunities for error.</dd>
    <dt>Takeaway</dt>
    <dd>This process was developed fairly recently, and all of its benefits and drawbacks will likely not be known for a few more years. It appears to be very environmentally friendly, but may require precise control such that expensive machinery is required, meaning that it would have a lot in common with CVD.</dd>

  <h3>Other Methods</h3>
  <p>Because of the high cost of the chemical vapor deposition method and the danger and environmental impact involved in hummer’s method for producing graphene oxide, a number of other methods have been developed recently that claim to be cheaper, more accessible, and more sustainable. One interesting method, first described in a 2012 article in the Journal of Materials Chemistry (<a href=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2012/JM/c2jm15944a>source</a>), involves heating pressurized sugar water in an autoclave. The authors of the paper claim that this grows graphene oxide via hydrothermal synthesis, a process where the components of a crystal are driven out of a water solution when the solution is heated and pressurized. The process sounds extremely easy, but there have not been many subsequent papers further delving into the process, likely because the paper did not go into great detail in describing their process.</p>
