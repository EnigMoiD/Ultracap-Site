<h4>So what?</h4>
<p>
Graphene ultracapacitors have the capacity to fundamentally change how we think about energy. No other technology sits so well on the intersection of power density and energy density - and that's exciting.<!--TL;DR but fuck you.-->

<h4>Big Picture</h4>

<p>
Because of the wide variety of applications that require power, it's impossible for any one power storage method to be the best suited to all of them. Some devices, such as electric cars, need incredibly high power output and can be fairly heavy. For other devices, such as cellphones and laptops, weight and volume are critical and various high energy density batteries are used.</p>
<p>
Unique among energy storage methods, ultracapacitors have extremely high power density without sacrificing too much energy density. These power density abilities make ultracapacitors very applicable in hybrid power systems by coupling them with batteries or fuel cells, which allows for large energy storage as well as short, high current bursts of power. This idea of using multiple energy storage methods together is incredibly powerful, because the benefits of two sources can be taken advantage of while limiting the importance of the weaknesses.
</p>
The ability of ultracapacitors to charge almost instantly and hold a large amount of charge has other important implications. Current trends in consumer electronics involve devices that charge over a long period of time or overnight. With graphene ultracapacitors all this will change. The state of modern energy transportation can be completely reimagined. Devices such as laptops can be made lighter and smaller with shorter battery lives. When power runs out, instead of plugging the device in and waiting, one can simply recharge in seconds and go back to working. 
</p>
<p>
We feel that graphene ultracapacitors will play a rising role in modern devices in the next 10-50 years. Their fast charge, high energy density, and high power density will allow them to be used in consumer electronic devices with great success. These graphene ultracapacitors are also much more friendly on the environment. As graphene production becomes more commonplace, these devices will be a cheap, ecological, and safe alternative in many products today.
